# OS-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
Implementation of Operating System CPU Scheduling Algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, Round Robin and Priority Scheduling.

Scheduling of processes/work is done to finish the work on time. CPU Scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while another process is delayed (in standby) due to unavailability of any resources such as I / O etc, thus making full use of the CPU. The purpose of CPU Scheduling is to make the system more efficient, faster, and fairer.
